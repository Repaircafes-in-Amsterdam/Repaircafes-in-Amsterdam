This agenda is an initiative of volunteers at Repair Cafés in Amsterdam. The goal is to make Repair Cafés more accessible by making them easier to find with their opening hours.

So far it lists {props.numRepairCafes} Repair Cafés but we are working on getting the information from more confirmed.

The website is open source, [see the source code on Github](https://github.com/Repaircafes-in-Amsterdam/Repaircafes-in-Amsterdam).

The information on this website is Amsterdam specific, for more information on Repair Cafes in general see [repaircafe.org](https://repaircafe.org).

If you would like to add a Repair Café or if any information is incorrect or incomplete, we would greatly appreciate an email. Adding preferably via [this questionnaire](https://forms.gle/AQJHMQ7xQsFJ77b47).

We are still looking for help with:

- SEO/Marketing. Someone who can approach other websites to link to this website. The website is optimized for findability, but needs backlinks to become findable in search engines.

- Community management. Someone who communicates with all Repair Cafés so that the calendar is as accurate and complete as possible and stays that way. Currently there are still a handful of Repair Cafés with whom we have not been able to get in touch at all.
- Visual / UI / UX Design. Someone who can contribute ideas on structure, navigation, how things should work and how it should look. We have a Figma file full of designs we'd love to share with you.
- Engineering. Mainly front-end development. Someone who can possibly co-develop and act as a backup. Someone with knowledge of React, Next and Tailwind, for example. See the [code on Github](https://github.com/Repaircafes-in-Amsterdam/Repaircafes-in-Amsterdam) for more info.
