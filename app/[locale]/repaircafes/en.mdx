<Header>What is a Repair Café?</Header>

Repair Cafés are free gatherings that revolve around repairing (together). At the location where the Repair Café is held, tools and materials are available to carry out all kinds of repairs. On clothing, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, toys, etc. Expert volunteers are also present, with repair knowledge and skills in a variety of areas.

Visitors bring broken items from home. At the Repair Café, they get to work with the experts. In this way, there is always something to learn. Those who have nothing to repair, take a cup of coffee or tea. Or will help with someone else's repair.

  <Summary>Should I sign up?</Summary>

You can just walk in during the opening hours of a Repair Café with your broken things, without an appointment. Some Repair Cafés work with sign-up sheets. If that's the case, the hostess or host will give you those hand them to you and explain them.

Sometimes it is quite busy. We try to keep the waiting time acceptable. That's why you can often only have one thing repaired at a time. After that you can rejoin the back for any subsequent item.

  <Summary>Leave repair?</Summary>

You cannot leave your repair; the idea is to work together with a volunteer. Do not hesitate to roll up your sleeves yourself. to do. Loosening screws or torquing a hem, for example, pretty much anyone can do. Many people can do some research online. If you want, you can also do the repair yourself, with guidance from the repair person.

  <Summary>Do you make home visits?</Summary>

In principle, no. The Repair Café is not a handyman service, but a meeting place where people can repair their stuff together. However, when visiting a Repair Café in your neighbourhood, you can make contact with one of the repairmen present and ask your question. Who knows someone might enjoy helping you out.

  <Summary>Guarantee?</Summary>

Repair Cafés do not give a guarantee. Many repairs succeed. But unfortunately it also happens that an attempt fails. Or a repair seems successful at first, but the item turns out to be out of order after returning home.

  <Summary>Will I always be helped?</Summary>

Almost always, but sometimes it can be very busy at a Repair Café and it can happen that you don't get your turn. Repairers also have the right to refuse repair of certain items, for example because they estimate that the repair is going to be too complicated.
